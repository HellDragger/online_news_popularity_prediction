# online_news_popularity_prediction
Used various Machine Learning Regression models to predict the popularity of a news article.

## Overview
The OnlineNewsPopularity dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, offers insights into various attributes of online news articles published over a span of two years. It encompasses a wide array of metrics that could potentially influence an article's popularity, offering researchers and practitioners a rich dataset to understand and predict online news virality.

## Key Features
* Dataset size: 39,644 instances and 61 attributes.
* Source: [Mashable](www.mashable.com)
* Timespan: The dataset captures articles published from January 7, 2013, to January 7, 2015.
* Attributes: The dataset comprises diverse attributes ranging from article content specifics such as the number of images, videos, links, and keywords to natural language processing features like subjectivity, polarity, and rate of positive and negative words, and even the day of the week of publication.

## Objective
The primary goal associated with this dataset is to predict the number of shares in social networks (popularity) an article can get. It becomes invaluable for researchers focusing on regression models, feature engineering, and even for those diving deep into natural language processing.

## Data Collection
The data was acquired by monitoring 60 articles per day that were deemed as relevant by Mashable's lead editors. Over 60 features were extracted from each article, making the dataset a comprehensive collection of metrics that can be harnessed to understand online news popularity.

## Acknowledgment
This dataset is publicly available at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/332/online+news+popularity). The collection of this data wouldn't have been possible without the dedication of its original creators, K. Fernandes, P. Vinagre, and P. Cortez.

## Usage
This dataset is used for a project for my specialization course in the same field to help me understand more about Regression in Supervised Learning and have a strong foundation in Natural Language Processing and Regression.
